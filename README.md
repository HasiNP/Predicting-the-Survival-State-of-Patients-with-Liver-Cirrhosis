# Predicting-the-Survival-State-of-Patients-with-Liver-Cirrhosis

Description
This repository contains the complete code and resources for a data science project focused on predicting the survival state of patients with liver cirrhosis. The goal of this project was to explore various machine learning algorithms and identify the most effective model for classifying patients into different survival states based on clinical and laboratory data.

The project includes the following components:

Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Implementation of multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, MLP Classifier, Random Forest Classifier)
Model evaluation and comparison using various metrics
Visualization of results and key findings
Introduction
Liver cirrhosis is a serious medical condition characterized by scarring of the liver, which can lead to liver failure and other severe health complications. Accurately predicting the survival state of patients with liver cirrhosis is crucial for effective treatment planning and patient management.

In this project, I aimed to leverage machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that can forecast the survival state of patients based on a variety of features, including demographic information, clinical findings, and laboratory test results. By combining comprehensive data analysis with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to provide valuable insights and tools for healthcare professionals.

Key Features of the Project
Data Collection and Preparation: Combined two datasets with similar structures to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. Handled missing values and performed label encoding for categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted detailed EDA to understand the data distribution, detect outliers, and identify correlations between features.
Feature Engineering: Normalized numerical features and applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and enhance model performance.
Model Implementation: Implemented and compared three machine learning models - Logistic Regression, MLP Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. Conducted cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Performed hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest Classifier using GridSearchCV to identify the best parameters for optimal performance.
Visualization: Visualized the results using various plots, including ROC curves and bar charts, to illustrate model performance and key findings.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting the survival state of liver cirrhosis patients. The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the best-performing model, providing accurate and reliable predictions. The insights gained from this project can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes.
